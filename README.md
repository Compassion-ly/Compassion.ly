# Project Title : COMPASSION.LY


**Project Description**  
COMPASSION.LY is an Android application designed to provide recommendations for fields of study and college majors based on the user's learning activities in the app.

- *Features :*
1. Learn
In this feature, users will engage in learning about the presented topics briefly. The topics provided are fundamental lessons from various courses and majors, enabling   users to gain brief insights into several majors displayed randomly. Users can choose to read a presented topic or skip it. After reading the presented topic, users are prompted to rate the topic.
   
3. Fields and Major Recommendation
Users will be provided with recommendations for fields of study and majors based on their learning activities in the application. These recommendations will continuously update as users engage in more learning. Therefore, the more learning and ratings provided by the user, the more accurate the recommendations will become.

4. Quick Recommendation
The Quick Recommendation feature is used to obtain field recommendations without going through the learning process. Users simply provide a description of at least 50 characters for 3 questions, and we will provide field recommendations by analyzing the given descriptions.

5. Major Introduction
The Major Introduction feature is designed to display information related to majors, including an introduction to the majors, the courses available in those majors, job prospects, and a list of universities offering those majors. This feature was created to provide users with detailed information about various majors and enrich their knowledge about a major after receiving recommendations from our application.
